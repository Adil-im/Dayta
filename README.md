# Kaiz

- Kaiz, short for  "Kaizen", a Japanese word meaning Continuous Improvement is a lightweight CLI automation tool for specialized industrial data entry. Built to make my bro's life a little easier.

## wiki

- Kaiz is written in Python(not the best language for a CLI tool i know) using the Click Module for CLI interface and SQLite for a lightweight, serverless, self-contained lovely SQL Database. Though it does not have any good looking TUI components from modules like Rich(maybe i will implement it in the future ), it performs all its main CRUD operations properly and maybe in the future i will add more functionalities to list specific data, for example: list the NON-TPE machine's data. 
>[!IMPORTANT]
> This project is specifically tailored for my brother's data Entry needs so, this might not be useful for you. Of course, you can fork this and tweak the data attributes and a few lines of code to have your own data entry CLI tool.
